<h2>Phrase Guessing Game</h2>

A phrase guessing game I build for my sixth front end development techdegree project. I used JavaScript and the document object model to build a game that randomly displays a hidden phrase. Players have to guess the phrase by choosing displayed letters so long as they have lives.
